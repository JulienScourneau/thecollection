## Introduction

An exercise when you need to generate a responsive html card with JavaScript object using DOM.

I chose to create pokemon presentation cards where we find the main information of it, such as its name, pok√©dex number, types, short description and a link to french version of pokepedia.

All cards display correctly on large and small screen.
